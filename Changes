0.010   2019-11-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Rename coerce rule modules again, revert to using lower_case
	  notation for the description part, because CamelCase is really,
	  REALLY ugly when we have many words.


0.009   2019-11-28  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Rename coerce rule module from
	  Data-Sah-Coerce-perl-str-str_strip_slashes to

	- [bugfix] Base {file,dir,path}name::unix on str instead of on
	  {file,dir,path}name because otherwise we have to provide
	  {file,dir,path}name::str_strip_slashes coercion rule names.


0.006   2019-07-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: high

        - UPDATE: this release is broken due to non-existing coercion rules. See
          0.007.

	- Coerce rule: rename str_strip_trailing_slash to
	  str_strip_slashes, also strip extra slashes like foo//bar ->
	  foo/bar. And (bugfix) do not strip '/' to ''.

	- Add schemas: {file,dir,path}name::unix, move strip_slashes coercion
	  rule to these schemas.

	- Add some tests.
